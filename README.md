Based on the contents of your lecture notes, here is a suggested assignment incorporating programming in Python and relevant libraries, particularly focusing on neural networks and TensorFlow:

### Assignment: Neural Network Implementation with TensorFlow

**Objective:** Implement and train a neural network using TensorFlow to classify data. This exercise will help you understand the basic architecture, functioning, and application of neural networks in solving real-world problems.

#### Part 1: Understanding Neural Networks
- **Task 1:** Write a brief explanation of how artificial neural networks are inspired by biological neural networks. Include information about neurons, activation functions, and the structure of simple neural networks.
- **Task 2:** Choose one activation function (Step Function, Logistic Function, or ReLU) and explain its purpose and how it affects the neural network's learning process.

#### Part 2: Implementing a Simple Neural Network
- **Task 3:** Using TensorFlow, create a simple neural network to classify whether it will rain today based on two inputs: humidity and air pressure. Use a dataset of your choice or create a simulated one with random numbers.
    - Define the architecture with an input layer, one hidden layer with a ReLU activation function, and an output layer.
    - Train the network using stochastic gradient descent and evaluate its performance.

#### Part 3: Image Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- **Task 4:** Implement a convolutional neural network using TensorFlow to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
    - Set up the dataset and preprocess the data.
    - Build a CNN with at least one convolutional layer, one pooling layer, and a dense layer for classification.
    - Train the model and evaluate its accuracy on the test set.

#### Part 4: Reflective Questions
- **Task 5:** Reflect on the process of training a neural network. Discuss the challenges you faced in terms of model architecture, overfitting, or any other aspect. How did you overcome these challenges?
- **Task 6:** Explore how changing different parameters (like the number of neurons in a layer, learning rate, or number of epochs) affects the performance of the network. Document your findings and provide a summary.

#### Submission Requirements:
- A Python script for each task.
- A report including your explanation for Task 1 and Task 2, the architecture of the neural networks used in Task 3 and Task 4, your reflections for Task 5, and your findings for Task 6.
- Screenshots or a video demonstrating the working model, especially for Task 3 and Task 4.
- Ensure that the code is well-commented to understand the structure and logic of your neural network.

### Resources:
- TensorFlow Documentation: [TensorFlow Docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- MNIST dataset: Available in TensorFlow or as a standalone dataset.

By working through these tasks, students will gain hands-on experience in neural network design and training, use of TensorFlow, and problem-solving with AI. Encourage them to experiment with different architectures and parameters to see the impact on model performance.

Objective: To introduce students to deep learning concepts and techniques through hands-on experience using Google Colab and Python.

Instructions:

1. Create a new notebook on Google Colab.
2. Install necessary libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
3. Load the MNIST dataset into your notebook. This dataset contains grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0-9.
4. Split the data into training and testing sets.
5. Build a simple neural network model using Keras that can classify the digits in the dataset. Use ReLU activation function and softmax output layer.
6. Train the model using the training set.
7. Evaluate the performance of the model using the testing set.
8. Visualize the results using Matplotlib or Seaborn.
9. Write a brief report summarizing your findings and discussing any challenges you faced during the implementation.

Grading Criteria:

* Completeness of the code (i.e., all required steps are implemented)
* Accuracy of the model (i.e., high classification accuracy on the testing set)
* Clarity of the report (i.e., easy to understand and well-structured)

Note: This lab is designed to be completed within two hours.
